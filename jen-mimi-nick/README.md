# Breath Holding Challenge App

## Features
* Countdown timer
* Excitement

We used the first two [ember101 screencasts](http://ember101.com/) & the [emberjs Starter Kit](http://emberjs.com/) as the base of our project. The app uses a timer set to 60 seconds, and instructions on what to do. Future versions could possibly have different durations to adjust for the user's current skill level.
